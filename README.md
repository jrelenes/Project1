# Homework #1: Vis in the wild

The purpose of this assignment is to get you thinking about visualization from a design persepective and to give you a bit of practice and exposure to making a web page (programming in HTML and CSS).

Find a visualization online somewhere that you think is interesting. Don't just pick a basic bar chart or scatter plot, but look around and see if you can find something that is especially attractive, insightful, moving, or interesting.

Once you've found that, take a screenshot and copy the URL. Use the index.html page in this repository as a base to describe the dataset.

- Add name, title, date, etc.
- Replace the screenshot of Sparky with the one you took and add the name and URL for the dataset.

Replace the Lorem Ipsum paragraphs below with a brief description about the visualization and why you chose it. Inculde the following information:

- **Summary** What is this visualization about?
- **Domain:** abstraction: Who are the users for this visuailzation? If there are any other domain considerations, mention them.
- **Data:** Describe the data shown in the visualization both using domain-specific language (ie, what's the dataset?) and data abstraction language (dataset types, data attribut types, etc., see the Data Abstraction chapter in the textbook).
- Task: Describe the tasks that the visualilzation can support using both domain-specific language (what are the specific/colloquial tasks that are supported?) and task abstraction language (action-pair tags, see the Task Abstraction chapter in the book).
- **Idiom**: What are the visualilzations and interactions in the visualization? 
- (Algorithm abstraction is not required for this assignment.)
- **Personal thoughts:** Do you think this is a good and/or interesting visualization? WHy or why not? What do you like about it?
